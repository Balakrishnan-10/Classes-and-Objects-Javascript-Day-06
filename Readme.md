# Classes & Objects :

## OOP's Task :

## Class :

* Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

```javascript
Syntax : 

class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}
```
## Objects in class :
* An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

```javascript
Syntax : 

variablename Object = new classname();
```
## Getter Method :

* Getters are functions that are used to access properties on an object. They are similar to methods, but they are not called on an instance of an object. Instead, they are called on the object itself. Getters are often used to access values from an object that are not directly accessible, such as nested properties.

```javascript
Syntax : 

 get name() {
    return ;
  }
```
## Setter Method :

* The setter is a method that allows you to set the value of a property in an object. It is a special type of method that is used to set the value of a property in an object. The setter method takes one argument, which is the value that you want to set the property to. The setter method is defined with the keyword "set".

```javascript
Syntax :
 
set name(value) {
   
},
```
